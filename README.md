# SmartSound 2.0.0
### What it does
Tired of going back and forth between tabs to mute & unmute background audio? 
SmartSound chrome extension takes care of that for you. 

### How it works
With this extension enabled on your chromium browser, new tabs playing audio 
will automatically mute older tabs playing audio. Tabs will be unmuted when 
audible tabs are closed or otherwise stop playing audio, based on which one was
the most recently muted.
