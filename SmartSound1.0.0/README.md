# SmartSound 1.0.0
### What it does
SmartSound is a chrome extension that was designed to manage background music.
If a new tab is playing audio, background music will be muted and will unmute 
itself when the new tab is no longer playing audio. 
*In this version, only one non-background audible tab is supported.*

### How to use it
To use SmartSound simply click the extension and press the "Set BGM tab" button
while on the tab you wish to play background music on.
